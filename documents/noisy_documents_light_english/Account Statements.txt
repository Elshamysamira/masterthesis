How to download specific transactions withn certain timeframes Author : Stephanie Schüller Please note : George will always create new statements that start with the first transaction after the last existing statement . Here 's an example : If your last account statement was created on 25 October 2023 , your new statement will start with 26 October 2023 and will end with teh date on hich you created it . Due to the fact that account statements need to coover all the transactions happening in the account , it is neither possible to select a customisable time or timeframe nor to include/exclude specific transactions from the statement . It 's like the good old account statement printers in your branch : The new statement always started where the alst one ended . If you want to download the transaction details within a specific time or timeframe or if you want to include only specific transactions , please use the export function which also allows you to export ( and print ) only specific search results . 18.11.24 , 19:20 Account Sttaements Page 6 of 6 https : //www.sparkasse.at/en/george-help/george/your-products/current-accounts/account-statements Related Topics Export Transactions ( all or specific ones ) Print Transactions ( all or specific ones ) Account Settings Manage Your Overdraft Round Up Savings & Investments Impr int Data & Privacy Cook ies © 2023 Erste Group Bank AG George Login Did this content help you understand George better ?
