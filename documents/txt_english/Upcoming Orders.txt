Standing Orders
Standing orders are recurring orders that
George executes always with the same receiver,
amount, and text (if entered). You sign standing
orders once and George will execute them at
the selected time interval. George will display
your standing orders under your upcoming
orders. And, of course, you can edit them.
Sweep Orders
Sweep orders are also recurring orders, but are
a little different from standing orders. When a
sweep order is set up, George will always
deduct the money that is above the defined
threshold and transfer it to wherever you decide
- most probably to your savings account. You
sign sweep orders once and George will execute
them at the selected time interval. You will see
your sweep orders in your upcoming orders and
can, of course, also edit them.

Scheduled orders are those orders that you
created and that have an execution date which
lies in the future. These orders are already
signed and appear in your "Upcoming orders"
list. If they are not signed yet, George will show
them under your "Open orders" in the "All about
your orders" section.
