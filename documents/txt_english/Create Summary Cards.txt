Last Article Update 03.01.2024
In case you want to combine amounts and
information of your different accounts and
cards, you can create summary cards for your
overview. This can come in handy, in case you
have different savings accounts and want to
see how much savings you have in total. Or you
could combine your giro account and your
credit card to see how much money you have
left to spend after the deduction. Try it for
yourself via the George browser version and
create summary cards that help you keep track
of your finances.
