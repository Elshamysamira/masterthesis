Apart from organising it the way you want to,
 
There, you can create summary cards,
meaning you can sum up several elements
in one product card (which is then shown
in your overview).
You are able to create sections, helping
you organise your accounts and cards in
various categories and areas to better
distinguish them from each other. 
You can also decide if you want to show
sums (in these sections) or not.
Plus, you have the option to decide which
accounts or cards to show and which
to hide from the overview.
If you're feeling not only organised, but
also ready for a bit of colour, you can
also change the background of your
overview. Just pick one of the offered
George designs.
