Your Payment
Orders
Last Article Update 03.05.2024
As almost everything in life, payment orders
too pass different stages. With George, it is
easy to track them as there are four different
status for your orders: open, upcoming, failed,
and executed. Please read further to get more
information on your payment orders.
You might think that as soon as you hit the
"sign" button, George will execute your order
immediately and automatically. But not so fast!
Though George is almost as fast as lightning,
there are other states than "executed" where
your money doesn't immediately land where it
should.

Open orders: 
Open orders are those orders that you set up
but didn't sign yet. You might forgot about
hitting the "Sign" button or you just wanted to
save it for later. Either way, open orders need
your signature so George can execute them. In
your order list, you can edit or delete your open
order, or sign it directly from within the order
list.
After you signed your order, George will do his
best to execute it as soon as possible, which -
in most cases - is immediately. 
 
Upcoming orders: 
When it comes to upcoming orders, you can
relax. These are orders that you already
signed and which George will execute in the
(near) future, for example orders where you set
the execution date to a date in the future. By
the way, these orders are called "Scheduled
orders". You can edit and cancel upcoming or
scheduled orders as long as the execution date

is after today. Also, George considers standing
orders and sweep orders as upcoming orders
too as they are repeated transfers. Thus, they
will be "upcoming" in the set interval. Edit your
standing orders by clicking onto the respective
account and then, on the left side select
"Standing Orders". For more information on
managing your standing orders, please click
here. 
 
Executed orders:
Executed orders are those orders that, well,
George did execute. Everything went well &
there is nothing else to do for you. By clicking
on an executed order, you can see all the order
details. You can also redo the order, delete
it from the overview or print it.
 
Failed orders: 
Sometimes, in very rare cases, George cannot
execute your order. This can be due to various
reasons. In this case, we recommend to repeat
the order and, if nothing helps, to contact your
personal advisor.
However, you will see this order too in your
order list under "Failed orders". 
No matter the status of your order, you will
always find it in the order list.
