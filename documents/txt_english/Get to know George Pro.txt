Please note: Selected access to George Pro
You can use George Pro if you have been granted
access by your bank. This is subject to specific
prerequisites, such as having a commercially used
payment account or belonging to a special customer
group.
You can determine if George Pro is available to you by
checking whether the activation option appears in the
main navigation of your George app (starting from
version "23.30" and newer) or your browser version or
not.

If George Pro is available to you in principle, you
can activate and use the Pro features at any
time. After logging in to George, you will find a
permanent and prominent "On/Off switch" for
George Pro in the main navigation. This switch
allows you to switch between the traditional
George view and the new George Pro
environment at any time.
An additional activation step, as you may know
from George plug-ins, is not necessary.
The activated view will also apply to future
logins to George, so you don't need to
separately activate George Pro with each new
visit. If at any point you decide to switch back
from George Pro to the traditional view, your
George Pro-specific activities and settings will
be retained until you activate George Pro again.
After initially activating George Pro, you will see
a brief introductory tutorial for George Pro. You
can, of course, revisit this tutorial at any time
while you are in the George Pro view, either
through the profile of your George app or the
George Pro settings of the browser version.

Account selection for George Pro
 
You can control the selection of your accounts
and cards for George Pro at any time. After the
initial activation of George Pro, George will
prompt you to make the appropriate selection.
Furthermore, you can adjust this selection
through the profile of your George app or the

George Pro settings in the browser version.
The account selection will apply to all future
sessions in the George Pro view. This selection
means that the respective accounts and cards
will be displayed on the George Pro overview
and taken into account for the cash flow
forecast by George Pro.
All other accounts and cards, such as those
used purely for personal purposes, will only be
visible in the traditional "normal" George view.
This way, you can use George Pro more
effectively for your business finances while
managing your personal finances conveniently
in the familiar George environment.
George Pro overview
Once you have activated George Pro, you will
see George in a new design specifically tailored
for George Pro, featuring a distinct main
navigation that guides you to the core functions
of George Pro.
App
When using George Pro with the George
app, the George Pro overview is divided into
3 sections:

https://www.sparkasse.at/en/george-help/george/george-pro/overview/get-to-know-george-pro
Browser version
In the upper navigation, you will find, on
the left, the toggle switch for George Pro,
which allows you to switch back to the
"regular" George view at any time. Next to
it, you'll find your profile as usual. Here, in
the context of George Pro, you can
specifically select the accounts for
George Pro and access the introductory
tutorial again.
In the main section, you will see the
accounts and cards you have selected for
George Pro. To access the details, history,
and functions of each account or card,
simply click on the respective account or
card, as you normally would.
In the lower navigation, regardless of
where you are within the George Pro
environment, you will find "Shortcuts" to
the George Pro overview, invoice
management, cash flow forecast, and
"More". The latter includes, in addition to
the non-George Pro-specific menus for
the store, the contact area, and the
currency converter, the George Pro
functionalities for export, labels, and
business partners.

When using George Pro with the web
browser version, the George Pro overview is
structured as follows:
 
In the top navigation, regardless of where
you are within the George Pro
environment, you will find "Shortcuts" to
the George Pro overview, invoice
management, cash flow forecast, export,
and "More". The latter includes functions
like labels and business partners in the
submenu, as well as the (non-George Pro-
specific) store. Additionally, you will find
the toggle switch for George Pro, links to
the (non-George Pro-specific)
communication center, and settings
(including the George Pro settings with
account selection).
In the main section, you will see the
accounts and cards you have chosen for
George Pro. To access the details, history,
and functions of each account or card,
simply click on the respective account or
card. Furthermore, on the overview page,
you'll find defined information sections for
the main functions of invoice
management, cash flow forecast, and
labels.

Invoice management
One of the key functions of George Pro is
invoice management. Not only can you store all
your incoming and outgoing invoices there, but
George Pro also automatically matches these
with your transactions to a large extent. This
allows you to get a calculation of your current
outstanding receivables and liabilities.
 
Automatic matching of invoices with
transactions
The outstanding receivables result from the
sum of all outstanding outgoing invoices that
have not been paid or not fully paid yet.
Unsettled refunds from incoming invoices also
contribute to the outstanding receivables.
The outstanding liabilities result from the sum
of all incoming invoices that have not been paid
or not fully paid yet. Additionally, outgoing
invoices marked for refunds, if they are still
open or partially open, are included in the
outstanding liabilities.
As soon as George Pro recognises, through
automatic matching with your account and
card transactions, that an invoice has been fully
or partially settled (or when you manually mark
an invoice as paid), George Pro no longer
18.11.24, 19:41
Get to know George Pro
Page 9 of 15
https://www.sparkasse.at/en/george-help/george/george-pro/overview/get-to-know-george-pro
considers it as part of the outstanding
receivables and liabilities.
George Pro automatically matches an invoice as
paid when the transaction parameters
(amount, partner - sender or receiver, and
payment reference) of one or more transactions
on your accounts and cards match the invoice
and indicate that it has been fully paid.
Cash receipts are generally automatically
marked as paid.
Once the sum of all linked transactions reaches
or exceeds the invoice amount, the invoice is
automatically marked as paid.
Manual linking of invoices and transactions
To manually link an invoice with one or more
transactions, please select the corresponding
transactions from your accounts and/or cards in
the invoice details. Once the sum of all linked
transactions reaches or exceeds the invoice
amount, the invoice is automatically marked as
paid here as well.
If you want to mark an invoice as paid even
without corresponding linked transactions, you
can do so in the invoice details.
 
Import and categorisation of invoices
In order to automatically match invoices with
transactions, George Pro naturally needs these
18.11.24, 19:41
Get to know George Pro
Page 10 of 15
https://www.sparkasse.at/en/george-help/george/george-pro/overview/get-to-know-george-pro
invoices in the first place. You can either
manually import/upload them in the George Pro
menu for invoices or you can use your own
George Pro mail service to send invoices to
your personal George Pro email address, which
is equivalent to an import.
 
After importing an invoice, George initially
displays it as unsorted. Please categorise the
invoice as either an incoming invoice or an
outgoing invoice. Furthermore, George Pro
provides you with additional options for
categorising an invoice, which are necessary for
it to be automatically reconciled with
transactions:
 
Classification as cash receipt or refund, if
applicable.
Invoice amount (gross amount) and, if
necessary, currency.
Partner name (sender or receiver), selectable
from your address book.
Payment reference. Unfortunately, if the
payment reference is used instead of the
payment reference, automatic transaction
matching cannot be performed.
Invoice date and due date.

Cashflow forecast
Automatic Forecast
In the Cashflow menu, George Pro shows you
the current status of your "liquidity today,"
which is the available amount of money in your
accounts and cards activated for George Pro.
However, the crucial advantage for organizing
your business finances is the cash flow
forecast. In this forecast, George Pro predicts
your liquidity for the next 12 months,taking into
account:
 
All invoices categorised with George Pro
based on their due date: Only open invoices
with future due dates are automatically
included in the forecast. Overdue invoices
and invoices with the same-day due date are
not automatically considered, but you can
include them in the forecast by using the
"Unconsidered Invoices" feature and
assigning a new expected date to the invoice.
Planned transactions such as standing
orders or scheduled transfers.
Outstanding credit card bills.
Loan installments.

Manual cash flow entries
Naturally, you can also manually create future
cashflow events. This applies to both income
and expenses, whether they are one-time or
recurring. For each event, you can enter an
expected transaction date, as well as specify an
interval.
Additionally, you can use the "eye icon" to
remove future cashflow events from the
forecast, allowing you to simulate specific
scenarios, such as the failure of a customer
payment or similar situations.
Warning threshold
In the separate cash flow settings, in addition
to selecting accounts specifically for the cash
flow forecast, you can also set a liquidity
threshold. When your actual or forecasted
liquidity in the future reaches this threshold,
George Pro will display a clear warning
message.
By default, a warning value of 0 is already set,
but you can adjust it as desired, and negative
values are also possible.
Data export
 
The export functionality of George Pro is
18.11.24, 19:41
Get to know George Pro
Page 13 of 15
https://www.sparkasse.at/en/george-help/george/george-pro/overview/get-to-know-george-pro
particularly useful for smooth collaboration with
your tax consultant. However, it has more to
offer. With it, you can export all transactions and
their related invoices ("no booking without a
document") for a custom-defined period.
George Pro then provides you with a .zip file for
download, which you can subsequently unpack.
This file contains:
Labels
 
With the label function, you can individually
organise and structure your business
transactions. This offers more flexibility
compared to the transaction categories typically
used in the personal finance manager. You can
create labels as needed and then assign
transactions to them.
 
You can use the function either through George
Pro's dedicated labels menu or directly in the
A list of all invoices and transactions in .csv
and .xlsx formats.
A separate folder for invoices, with
subfolders for incoming invoices and
outgoing invoices.

transaction history or transaction details. There,
you can both create new labels and apply labels
to transactions, individually or in bulk.
Business partners
 
With George Pro, you can create business
partners in addition to the address book
contacts typically used for personal purposes.
This is necessary, for example, to automatically
link invoices with transactions. For each
business partner, you can also view the
associated invoices.
You can create business partners through the
dedicated menu or directly when creating and
categorising invoices.
