Open Orders
Last Article Update 10.09.2024
 
With George, you can easily create and
manage your orders. If you create an order
without signing it, George lists it in your
"Upcoming orders" as "Open order". Please
read further to find out everything about your
open orders.
If you created an order - no matter if it's a
standard SEPA transfer, a foreign transfer,
an own transfer, a tax authority payment,
a direct debit or any other type of order -
without signing it, George will display these
as open orders.
