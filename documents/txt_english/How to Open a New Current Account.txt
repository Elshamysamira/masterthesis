How to Open a
New Current
Account
Last Article Update 14.08.2024
Current accounts are the most important tool
to organise you daily financial matters.
Sometimes, it can even make sense to have
mor than one current account. Opening an
additional current account can help you keep
your finances clear and easy to manage. For
example, you can use one account for personal
purposes and another jointly with someone
else for shared household expenses. A
separate account allows for clear distinction
between different financial areas and ensures
more efficient organisation of your financial
matters.
Whether it's your first current account with
Erste Bank & Sparkasse or an additional one:
here’s how to open a new current account.
