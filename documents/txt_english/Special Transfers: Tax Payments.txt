Transferring with George
1. Create a new transfer.
2. You can either select a template that you
already saved or create a manual transfer. 
3. If you create a manual transfer, start
typing in "Finanz". George will then give you
a list of tax authorities that you can select. If
the tax authority is not to be found on the
list, try to type in their short code (e.g.
"FA15") instead. If there is still no
suggestion, make sure to have an up-to-
date IBAN and short code by cross-checking
it with the official list on their Website.
Otherwise, select the suggestion and
George will prefill the recipient name and
IBAN for you.

tax number. In Austria, this number has 9

to add tax positions to your transfer or if you
want to execute a "Payment of Balance"
where you can transfer money without
defining tax positions.
