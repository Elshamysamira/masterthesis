What's the
Difference
between Your
Order List and
Your Transaction
History?
Last Article Update 04.09.2024
Your Transactions History and your Order List
are both the place to go when you are looking
for any information about your transfers.
Despite both providing an overview as well as
specific information, the order list and the
transactions history contain different
information.
The order list takes into account transfers of all
your accounts, cards, and other financial
products. George categorises your orders
according to their status, i.e., open, executed,
or failed. Open orders remain in the list until you
sign them. Executed and failed orders are
stored in the order list for 180 days.
The transactions history is specific for the
respective account, card, or financial product.
