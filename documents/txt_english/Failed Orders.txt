George will always try to execute your orders
successfully and as fast as lightning. However,
sometimes, the universe lets George down and
he can't execute your order.

George understands that it's frustrating when
orders are not executed. Though he's hard
working and can execute almost all orders, it
can happen that George must tell you that your
order failed. This can be due to many reasons
and if George knows why (e. g. insufficient
balance), he will definitely tell you. You can see
any failed orders in your Payment Orders. 
 
If you need additional information on your failed
order, you can always contact your personal
advisor.
