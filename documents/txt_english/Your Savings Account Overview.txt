Your Savings
Account Overview
Last Article Update 22.01.2024
It is not only important to have an overview of
your current account. This also makes sense
for savings accounts. Because in your
overview you can see which incoming
transactions have been made, whether you
have made an own transfer or how often you
have rounded up when paying if you have
activated Round Up Savings.
