Split Now
Last Article Update 13.08.2024
It can make sense to split a credit card
payment into several instalments if you have
larger expenses but cannot or do not want to
pay the entire amount immediately. By using
Split Now, you can spread the financial burden
and thus be able to handle a larger expense in
the short term without using your entire
budget.
 
With Split Now you can split credit card
payments over 50 euros up to a total of 4,800
euros into several monthly statements. You pay
the first instalment with the current monthly
statement, the further instalments are then due
the following months.
 
Fees may apply for the use of Split Now. If so,
George will display these charges directly to
you when you activate the service.
