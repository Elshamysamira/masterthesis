Your Credit Card
History
Last Article Update 15.01.2024
In the lifetime of a credit card, you might make
a lot of payments with it. Some are regular and
recurring, some of them might be special
purchaces for certain occasions. Either way,
it's good to keep track of what you're buying
and paying for. With George, you can access
your credit card history any time and easily
with just a few clicks.

you get the 7 years archive plugin (available in the
George Store), you can extend this time period to 7
