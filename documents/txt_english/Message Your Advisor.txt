George makes banking easy, smooth and
convenient for you. But even then, sometimes
you might need a little advice on something or
help with a problem you have facing your
finances. In that case, you don't necessarily
have to visit a branch. Just message your
advisor via George. They will get back to you
as soon as possible and help you with your
question(s).

George and your advisor will happily assist you
digitally anytime. But some topics need to be
discussed in person or via phone call. If this is
the case, you can easily book an
appointment and talk things through in more
detail.
