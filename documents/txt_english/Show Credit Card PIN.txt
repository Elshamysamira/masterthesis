A small hint
Change the PIN of your s credit card to your desired
code free of charge at the self-service device in the
self-service foyer of a branch. To do this, choose 4
digits that you can easily remember.
But please do not choose any easily guessable number
combinations such as your year of birth or postcode.
Your desired code remains the same even if you reorder
or renew your card.
A safety advice
Please make sure that only you see your PIN code. This
is for your eyes only.
