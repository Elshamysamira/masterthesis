How to make an international (non-
SEPA transfer
Single Euro Payments Area (SEPA
The Single Euro Payments Area
SEPA currently consists of 36 countries,
amongst them all 27 EU member states.
SEPA's goal is to unify cashless payments in
Euro amongst those within the area. A SEPA
transfer works the same way as a domestic
transfer. The country doesn't need to have
EUR as a currency to take part in SEPA, as
long as the transfer is done in EUR.
Of course, that means that if an international
transfer even within the SEPA area is done in
another currency than EUR, it automatically
becomes a foreign transfer (non-SEPA.
Also, transfers to countries outside of SEPA
will always be foreign transfers (non-SEPA.
As of 2022, the following countries are part
of SEPA
 Andorra
 Austria
 Belgium
 Bulgaria
 Croatia
 Cyprus
 Czech Republic

1. From your overview, look for the account from
which you want to send money internationally
and click on "New transfer.
 
2. The transfer form now opens. As default,
George sets up a SEPA transfer. This will change
as soon as you enter an IBAN or account
number that is outside the SEPA region. Or if
you enter a currency other than EUR.
 
3. As when preparing a regular SEPA
transfer, select the recipient account and, of
course, the amount.

4. As you can see, George now displays
additional fields such as address details. Since
there are expenses for foreign transfers, you
can decide who will accept them: You, the
recipient, or you both share them equally. If you
fully or partially accept them, you can also
select an account that George should charge for
Please note
As soon as you select a partner account with a non-
SEPA IBAN, enter a non-SEPA account number
or change the currency from Euro to any other
currency, George changes the transfer automatically
into a non-SEPA transfer.
You don't need a separate form for foreign transfers
anymore. George will adapt the transfer form
automatically while you are entering the details.

the expenses.
5. Now you can also enter either a text or a
payment reference. This input, however, is
optional. 
6. In the next step, you can either save this
transfer for later, save the transfer and
immediately prepare a new one, or sign it right
away.

International transfers come with fees
Unfortunately, I cannot tell you the absolute amount of
fees that come with international transfers. This
depends on the country, the amount, and also the
respective bank. For this purpose, please read the
terms and conditions of your bank or ask your personal
advisor.
