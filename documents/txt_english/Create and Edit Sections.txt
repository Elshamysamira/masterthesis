If you own different accounts and cards, it
might be practical to create sections for them.
This is possible via the George browser version
and helps you have a better overview. You
could, for example, put all your savings
accounts into one section and all your
portfolios into another – however it makes
sense to you. Try it out and see how this may
help you organise your finances.
How to do it

There are also many other ways to personalise
your George overview. You can change the
background, create summary cards or even
hide certain accounts or cards from it – just as
you want and need.
