How to download specific transactions within certain timeframes Atuhor : Stephanie Schüller lPease note : Gorge will always create new statements that start with the first transaction after the last existing statement . Here 's an example : If your last account statement was cretaed on 25 October 2023 , your ew statement will start with 26 October 2023 and will end gwith the date on which you created it . Due to the fact that account statements need to cover vall the transactions happening in the account , it is neither possible to select a customisable time or timeframe nor to include/exclude specific transactions frm the statement . It 's like the good old account statement printers in oyur branch : The new statement always started where the last one ended .
